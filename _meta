  <title>LSB support for Moblin Linux</title>
  <description>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is an attempt to develop a set of
standards that will increase compatibility among Linux distributions.
The moblin-lsb package provides utilities needed for LSB Compliant
Applications.  It also contains requirements that will ensure that all
components required by the LSB that are provided by Red Hat Linux are
installed on the system.
